This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install Node.js, open this directory in a terminal, and then run `npm install` to download this project's dependencies. Then, run the database seed script from the command line with `node seed.js`, which should create a file called bakery.db in this folder.

Then, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
